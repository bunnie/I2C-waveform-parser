I2C waveform parser

At the moment, this is just a quick hack script that will take waveform
data from an oscilloscope (in this case, CSV format generated by an MSO-9000
from Link Instruments) and extract I2C metadata, assuming channel A0 is clock
and A1 is data.

The input parser for the script can be fairly quickly adjusted to parse any
fixed-time interval CSV data; you will just need to rotate the column indices
accordingly. 

The resulting output can be viewed in a terminal and interacted with using
the keyboard. 

test.CSB is a test file that one can use to validate the current python script.
